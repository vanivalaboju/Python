# Floating point number - it allows to create decimals upto a very high demand
# A float occupies 24 bytes of memory
# 9 is considered to be an integer while 9.0 is a float
f1 = 10
f2 = 30
f3 = f2/f1
print(f3)
# python convert int to int also it prints output as float number
# python is very intelligent knows that in division there are more chances it will be float
