# Task#1
# Explain the difference between the = operator and the == operator in python
# The = is a simple assignment operator. It assigns values from right side operands 
# to the left side operand. 
#  a = 5
# here the variable a is assigned value as 5
# #  While on the other hand == checks if the values of two operands are equal or not.
# for Example
c = 10
d = 20
if c == d:
 print("c is equal to d")
else:
 print("c is not equal to d")

# What does the ** operator do in python and how is it used
# The ** operator does exponentiation 
# Example: x = 2,y = 5    print(x ** y) 
        # same as 2*2*2*2*2



# What does the ^ operator do in python and in what context is it commonly used
# Bitwise XOR operator are used to compare (binary) numbers:
   # XOR

# Sets each bit to 1 if only one of two bits is 1
# Example: a = 60 # 60 = 0011 1100

b = 13 # 13 = 0000 1101

# Binary XOR

c = a ^ b # 49 = 0011 0001
